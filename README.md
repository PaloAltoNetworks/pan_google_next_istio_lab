# Instructions 

#### kubectl

Instructions to install kubectl can be found at: ```https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/```

#### Install gcloud skd and tools 

Instructions to install the Google cloud SKD can be found at: ```https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install```


#### Download the kubernetes (GKE) credentials to your local system. 

 - You will need the GKE cluster name, the zone name and the project id 
 - Execute ``` gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> --zone <zone name> --project <project name> ```

#### Create a kubernetes cluster role binding 

Execute the following command:

```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --user=$(gcloud config get-value core/account)
```

`Script link`: ``` https://github.com/vinayvenkat/gke_k8s_deployer/blob/master/cluster-role.sh ```

#### Download the Istio code base if you don't have Istio already installed

Execute the following command:

   ``` ./download_istio.sh ``` 


#### Setup and deploy the Istio Custom Resource Definitions 

   Note: It is assumed that the scripts will be executed from 
  		 the current working directory. In other words 
		 ``` ~/$HOME/pan_google_next_istio_lab/``` directory. 

   Execute the following command: 
   ``` ./istio-cfg.sh install_istio ```

`Script link`: ``` https://github.com/vinayvenkat/gke_k8s_deployer/blob/master/istio-cfg.sh ```

#### Verify the Istio installation 

 - Ensure that Istio and all its components have been successfully installed. 
 - Execute: ```kubectl get po -n istio-system```

   The output should resemble: 
   ```
